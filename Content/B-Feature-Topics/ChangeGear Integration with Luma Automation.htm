        <h1>ChangeGear Integration with Luma Automation</h1>
        <p>ChangeGear now allows for the configuration and triggering of an automation workflow by providing an interface for ChangeGear Administrators to enter the authentication information, type, automation workflow and the mappings to be used. ChangeGear Administrator users can configure a workflow </p>
        <p>- The action, conditions under which the automation workflows would be triggered is configured and set up via ChangeGear Ticket workflow editors configure a ticket workflow where the automation workflow runs and results are recorded when a ticket action is performed. </p>
        <p>so that when a ticket action is performed the automation workflow is run and the results recorded</p>
        <p>To integrate with the automation solution, the ability to trigger the execution of an automation workflow is required. For the first version, this capability to be available via ticket workflows.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Luma Automation is a SaaS solution that allows for the automation of manual business processes to be more efficient and reliable which in turn facilitates the orchestration of these tasks in a workflow.</p>
        <p>This feature is to design and implement the integration of Luma Automation with ChangeGear.</p>
        <p>As a ChangeGear admin user,</p>
        <p>I would like to configure a ticket workflow</p>
        <p>so that when a ticket action is performed the automation workflow is run and the results recorded</p>
        <p>To integrate with the automation solution, the ability to trigger the execution of an automation workflow is required. For the first version, this capability to be available via ticket workflows.</p>
        <p>Future enhancements need to include being able to trigger the workflows from other types like Users etc.</p>
        <p>To accomplish the above,</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
