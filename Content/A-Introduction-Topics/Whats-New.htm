        <p>Repository maintenance will be displayed as follows:</p>
        <p>The system will retrieve all member documents and include them in MYiCLUBonline.</p>
        <p>The agreement (contract) will be listed first, and then all other documents will be listed in descending order, meaning that those with the most recent date will be first in the list.</p>
        <p>The member document name will be changed from PDF to Member Document.</p>
        <p>The top five (5) documents in the list will be shown. If more than five (5) documents are listed, then a scroll bar will appear allowing members to scroll through the list.</p>
